//The company is building many card based games (e.g. solitaire, hearts, blackjack, poker, etc.) You notice that every game has it's own implementation of Card and Deck classes - complete mayham! You quickly get to work designing a single set of Card and Deck classes that can be shared across most (if not all) games.  Some points to consider:
//
//Many games allow a card to be either face up or face down
//Some cards have a face (Jack, Queen, King)
//All cards have a numeric value, sometimes they have more than one value (i.e. an Ace can be a 1 or a 11 in blackjack), and different games might assign different values to different cards (i.e. in blackjack, the face cards are all worth 10, but in other games they are worth 11, 12, and 13 for Jack, Queen, and King, respectively.
//Many games have separate "piles" of cards, such as a "draw" pile and a "discard" pile
//Some games allow for more than one player
