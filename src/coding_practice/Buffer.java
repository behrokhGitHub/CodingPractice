 * Implement a buffer data structure "Buffer" that allows setting a character at a given position 
 * (indexes from 0 and up) in the buffer, and finding the lowest position of a given character.  
 * As before, design the interfaces and analyze each method's big-O.  
 * After this is done, also add support for deleting a character from a position:
 * buf.Set(position, character)
 * buf.Find(character)
 * additional work: buf.Delete(position)
